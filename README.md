This app is intended for Frosthaven players who put down a scenario or quest for a while, then came back to it and forgot where the story was when they left off.

The text content here is entirely built from /u/dwarf74's labor of love here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZLRcVEWqyApPVo2Zxs9-fpW9XlKGr5J4wzlWWESBtE/ I made slight corrections to typos here and there, capitalizing some things that were missed. Nothing major.

I am using the background from the Gloomhaven Card browser (https://www.gloomhavencards.com/) which is cool and what inspired me to do this.

If you select a scenario, you should see the entire chain of backstory. If there's multiple branches converging to a single scenario, you will get prompted to ask how you got here. I added hover tooltips to characters that dwarf74 was kind enough to leave a glossary of. Those names are bolded.

I don't own any of this content.
